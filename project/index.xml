Plasma Instability in Hall Thrusters - A Numerical Study</title><link>https://example.com/project/plasma_ii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/plasma_ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hall effect thrusters (HETs) are widely used in space propulsion systems due to their high thrust-to-power ratio, high specific impulse, high efficiency, and simple structure. However, partial plasma confinement is fundamental to Hall Thrusters Physics and leads to a variety of instabilities such as Modified Two Stream Instability and Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability that negatively impact the efficiency and overall performance of the thrusters. In this study, we numerically solve the general dispersion relation for Hall thrusters to better understand these instabilities and improve the design process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two stage double frequency up-conversion scheme</title><link>https://example.com/project/superhet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/superhet/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Superconducting qubits have emerged as one of the front-runners in the development of quantum processors and require amplitude and phase modulated microwave frequency pulses for control and measurement. A common method for generating these pulses is the single side band up-conversion scheme which utilizes an IQ Mixer and two modulating signals from arbitrary waveform generators. In this thesis, we discuss an alternative scheme, referred to as double frequency up-conversion, which aims to reduce the number of required modulating signals to one, eschews periodic calibrations and accommodates a wider range of qubit frequencies. We partially implement this scheme, demonstrate the measurement and analysis of a single qubit, and present evidence that the long-term stability of the alternative scheme is comparable to that of the standard setup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing Twisted Bilayer Graphene Based Devices</title><link>https://example.com/project/thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>The investigation of the characteristics of van der Waals heterostructures is a rapidly growing area of research in condensed matter physics, with significant potential but still in its infancy. Graphene, known as a &amp;ldquo;wonder material&amp;rdquo; due to its exceptional properties such as superior electrical conductivity compared to copper and strength 200 times that of steel, had yet to exhibit the quantum phenomenon of superconductivity. However, in 2018, a remarkable discovery revealed that superconductivity could be achieved in Twisted Bilayer Graphene, a structure consisting of two layers of graphene placed on top of each other with a rotation angle near the &amp;ldquo;Magic Angle&amp;rdquo; of 1.1 degrees. These findings and many others have spurred a surge of research in the field of twistronics in experimental condensed matter physics, leading to the need for optimization and standardization of fabrication procedures for reproducibility and improve the quality of stacks. In this thesis, we aim to standardize the method of fabricating twisted Bilayer Graphene using the modified Dry Stacking Method and the recent technique of tear and stack procedure. We conclude with the successful implementation of a standardized step-by-step procedure for a typical TBLG stack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I. Plasma Instability in Hall Thrusters - An Analytical Study</title><link>https://example.com/project/plasma_i/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/plasma_i/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hall Thrusters now plays a prominent role in space propulsion systems owing to its high thrust-to-power ratio, high specific impulse, high efficiency, and simple structure. Partial plasma confinement is fundamental to Hall Thrusters Physics, but that also leads to a variety of instabilities like Modified Two Stream Instability and Electron Cyclotron Drift Instability which takes a toll on efficiency and overall performance of the Thrusters. Although Numerical stimulations have replicated many of these, the cause of these instabilities are still in dark and it is of importance that we have a very solid theoretical understanding of Working Principles. Here, we derive a generic linear dispersion relation for Hall thrusters and attempt to analytically explain these observed instabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Superconducting Tunnel Junctions</title><link>https://example.com/project/tunneljunc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/tunneljunc/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the pioneering methods of confirming the band gap predicted by the
BCS theory was using superconducting tunnel junctions. We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected. Python programs are
also developed for automatic data analysis and parameter extraction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graphene - Electronic Properties and Defects</title><link>https://example.com/project/graphene/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/graphene/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Graphene is one of the first 2-D materials to be discovered. We examine its
physical structure and review the tight-binding model of Graphene with the next-
nearest neighbour interaction. Only considering nearest neighbour hopping, we
demonstrate the importance of Dirac points, the onset of the relativistic for-
mulation and electrons acquiring pseudo-spin. We also show the e-h symmetry
breaking on the inclusion of next-nearest hopping. Additionally, we derive the
commonly stated density of states using Greenâ€™s function. Further, we model
substitutional impurities in the Graphene lattice by the Slater-Koster model and
derive the change in the band structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Symplectic Geometry</title><link>https://example.com/project/sympl_geo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/sympl_geo/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this report we study Symplectic Geometry, an outgrowth of classical mechanics. We give a comprehensible introduction and further provide an elementary introduction to its celebrated results in mathematical physics known as geometric quantization, a way of passing from a classical mechanical system to a quantum mechanical system by methods from symplectic geometry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>fractional Brownian Motion (fBM)</title><link>https://example.com/project/fracbrown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/fracbrown/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Brownian Motion serves as the foundation of a myriad of statistical modelling. Here, we discuss the statistical properties of Weiner processes, and introduce Brownian Motion as a continuous Weiner process. Further, we model it using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations and study the motion of particles in a 1-D box. This is supplemented by simulations. Further, &lt;em>fractional Brownian Motion&lt;/em> is introduced as a generalisation and its statistical properties are studied. Its non-trivial simulation is also done by two methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development of a Data Acquisition system</title><link>https://example.com/project/dataacq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/dataacq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Basket of experiments in the UG lab.</title><link>https://example.com/project/uglab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/uglab/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Database GUI design.</title><link>https://example.com/project/gui_python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/gui_python/</guid><description>&lt;p>College Database&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unconventional Superconductivity</title><link>https://example.com/project/nius/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/project/nius/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unconventional Superconductivity&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
