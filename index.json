A common method for generating these pulses is the single side band up-conversion scheme which utilizes an IQ Mixer and two modulating signals from arbitrary waveform generators. In this thesis, we discuss an alternative scheme, referred to as double frequency up-conversion, which aims to reduce the number of required modulating signals to one, eschews periodic calibrations and accommodates a wider range of qubit frequencies. We partially implement this scheme, demonstrate the measurement and analysis of a single qubit, and present evidence that the long-term stability of the alternative scheme is comparable to that of the standard setup.\n","date":1672358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672358400,"objectID":"8f19341a798c01cde9e95fcda31ff528","permalink":"https://example.com/project/superhet/","publishdate":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/superhet/","section":"project","summary":"We tested a double frequency upconversion scheme to generate microwave pulses for control and readout of qubits which aims to reduce the number of required modulating signals to one, eschews periodic calibrations and accommodates a wider range of qubit frequencies","tags":["QC","inst"],"title":"Two stage double frequency up-conversion scheme","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The investigation of the characteristics of van der Waals heterostructures is a rapidly growing area of research in condensed matter physics, with significant potential but still in its infancy. Graphene, known as a “wonder material” due to its exceptional properties such as superior electrical conductivity compared to copper and strength 200 times that of steel, had yet to exhibit the quantum phenomenon of superconductivity. However, in 2018, a remarkable discovery revealed that superconductivity could be achieved in Twisted Bilayer Graphene, a structure consisting of two layers of graphene placed on top of each other with a rotation angle near the “Magic Angle” of 1.1 degrees. These findings and many others have spurred a surge of research in the field of twistronics in experimental condensed matter physics, leading to the need for optimization and standardization of fabrication procedures for reproducibility and improve the quality of stacks. In this thesis, we aim to standardize the method of fabricating twisted Bilayer Graphene using the modified Dry Stacking Method and the recent technique of tear and stack procedure. We conclude with the successful implementation of a standardized step-by-step procedure for a typical TBLG stack.\n","date":166968e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672358400,"objectID":"5ec7462a205ac475b3716bc3f67e42ef","permalink":"https://example.com/project/thesis/","publishdate":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Project involved designing and standardizing a step-by-step procedure for hBN encapsulated tBLG stack.","tags":["hetero","condensed"],"title":"Designing Twisted Bilayer Graphene Based Devices","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hall Thrusters now plays a prominent role in space propulsion systems owing to its high thrust-to-power ratio, high specific impulse, high efficiency, and simple structure.
