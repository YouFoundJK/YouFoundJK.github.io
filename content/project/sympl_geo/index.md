title: Symplectic Geometry
summary: Reading Project on the Mathematical framework of Classical Mechanics. Incorporates a good understanding of Lie Algebra, Symplectic Manifolds and Complex vector spaces to learn about the analogy between Wave - Corpuscular theory of light and Geometric quantization.

In this report we study Symplectic Geometry, an outgrowth of classical mechanics. We give a comprehensible introduction and further provide an elementary introduction to its celebrated results in mathematical physics known as geometric quantization, a way of passing from a classical mechanical system to a quantum mechanical system by methods from symplectic geometry.
