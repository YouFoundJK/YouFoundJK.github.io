I have just completed my postgraduation (Int. M.Sc. in Physics) from the Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, Mumbai. I love multidisciplinary approach were I take up inspirations from across disciplines and apply it elsewhere. Although I am inclined more towards theoretical and computations aspects in physics, I have a fair experience in experimental physics as well. My specialisation include Plasma Physics, Superconductivity and 2D Heterostructures.

Recently, I have been working in Analying the microinstabilities in Hall Thrusters. I have proposed an analytical model and am currently working on matching it with the experimental finding using Numerical and theoretical analysis.
